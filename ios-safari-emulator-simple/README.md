## Before you test

All these commands are done from a terminal window.  If you've already done
a step, you can safely ignore that command.

Open this directory:  `cd APPIUM-LOCATION/appium-training-matrix-mobile-web/ios-safari-emulator-simple`

Install Gems:  `bundle update`

You're ready to go!

## [simple.rb](simple.rb)

Again a Companion Step by Step Guide is at http://dentedghost.blogspot.com/2015/05/ios-safari-emulator-simple-introduction.html <br/>

Run the test by making sure Appium Server is running.
In a terminal you opened above, run `ruby simple.rb`
